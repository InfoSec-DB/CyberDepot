### Advanced 2FA Bypass via CSRF: Exploiting Two-Factor Authentication Vulnerabilities

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to exploit vulnerabilities in the two-factor authentication (2FA) process using Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). By manipulating 2FA requests, an attacker can potentially bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to a user’s account. 


## Setting Up the Environment

#### Prerequisites

-   A vulnerable web application with 2FA and CSRF vulnerabilities.
-   BurpSuite installed and configured to intercept HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
-   An account on the target web application with 2FA enabled.

#### Configuring BurpSuite

1.  **Open BurpSuite**:
    -   Launch BurpSuite and navigate to the "Proxy" tab.
    -   Click on "Intercept" to ensure it is turned on.
2.  **Set Up Your Browser**:
    -   Open your browser settings and configure the proxy settings to use `127.0.0.1` and port `8080` (default BurpSuite settings).
    -   Ensure you have installed BurpSuite's CA certificate in your browser to avoid SSL/TLS issues. This can be done by going to BurpSuite's "Proxy" > "Options" > "Import / Export CA Certificate".

### 2. Understanding CSRF and 2FA

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

-   CSRF is an attack that forces a user to execute unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated. By exploiting the trust that a web application has in the user’s browser, an attacker can trick the user into submitting requests unknowingly.

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

-   2FA adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication (e.g., a code sent to a mobile device) in addition to the user’s password.

### 3. Identifying the Vulnerability

#### Analyze the 2FA Implementation

1.  **Log in to the Target Web Application**:
    
    -   Enter your username and password to log in.
    -   You will be prompted to enter a 2FA code.
2.  **Capture the 2FA Request in BurpSuite**:
    
    -   Ensure interception is turned on in BurpSuite.
    -   Enter the 2FA code and submit the form.
    -   BurpSuite will capture the HTTP request. For example:
                
        `POST /verify_2fa HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Content-Length: 40
        
        code=123456&session=abcdef123456` 
        
3.  **Analyze the Request**:
    
    -   Examine the request parameters. Look for the 2FA code and session identifiers.

### 4. Crafting the CSRF Attack

#### Create a Malicious HTML Form

1.  **Craft the CSRF Payload**:
    
    -   Create an HTML file with a form that mimics the 2FA request. For example:
        
        `<html>
        <body>
          <form action="http://example.com/verify_2fa" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="code" value="123456">
            <input type="hidden" name="session" value="abcdef123456">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit request">
          </form>
          <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script>
        </body>
        </html>` 
        
2.  **Host the HTML File**:
    
    -   Host this HTML file on a server controlled by the attacker or use a local web server.

### 5. Exploiting the CSRF Vulnerability

#### Deliver the Payload

1.  **Send the Link to the Victim**:
    
    -   Trick the victim into visiting the malicious HTML file. This can be done via email, social engineering, or other means.
2.  **Victim Executes the CSRF Payload**:
    
    -   When the victim opens the link, the form is submitted automatically, sending the 2FA code and session information to the target web application.

### 6. Bypassing 2FA and Gaining Access

#### Verify the Attack

1.  **Check if the 2FA Was Bypassed**:
    
    -   If successful, the attack will bypass the 2FA check, and the attacker will gain access to the user’s account.
2.  **Log in as the Victim**:
    
    -   Use the victim's session information or credentials to log in to the account without needing the 2FA code.

### Additional Examples and Advanced Techniques

#### Example: Using BurpSuite to Automate the Attack

-   Use BurpSuite's Intruder tool to automate the attack by sending multiple requests with different 2FA codes:
    1.  Intercept the 2FA request.
    2.  Send the request to Intruder by right-clicking on the request and selecting "Send to Intruder".
    3.  Set the payload position for the `code` parameter.
    4.  Configure the payload set with possible 2FA codes.
    5.  Start the attack and analyze the responses.

### Mitigation Strategies

To prevent 2FA bypass attacks via CSRF, consider implementing the following security measures:

1.  **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**:
    
    -   Include unique, unpredictable tokens in all sensitive requests to prevent CSRF attacks.
2.  **Secure Cookie Attributes**:
    
    -   Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies to prevent them from being accessed via JavaScript and ensure they are only sent over HTTPS.
3.  **Implement SameSite Cookies**:
    
    -   Use the `SameSite` attribute for cookies to control how cookies are sent with cross-site requests.
4.  **Rate Limiting**:
    
    -   Implement rate limiting on 2FA verification attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
5.  **Monitor and Log 2FA Attempts**:
    
    -   Monitor and log all 2FA attempts and alert administrators of suspicious activity.
