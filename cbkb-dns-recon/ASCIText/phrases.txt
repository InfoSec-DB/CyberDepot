Hack the planet
There is no spoon
I’m in
My name is Neo
The only winning move is not to play
We’re in
Mess with the best, die like the rest
Hackers of the world unite
I see dead people
The world isn't run by weapons anymore or energy or money. It's run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data
Shall we play a game?
This is my world!
Everything they told you was a lie
We're hackers
Are you a hacker?
Welcome to the real world
It's not a bug, it's a feature
C:\DOS\RUN
God gave us roots so we could hack them
I fight for the users
Information wants to be free
If you want to survive out here, you've got to know where your towel is
This is your system now
You've been hacked
The Internet is the ultimate weapon
We are the digital underground
We hack the planet
What we do is touch the untouchable and we look at the unseeable
Code is just like writing
You can't stop the signal
The Net is vast and infinite
Everything is connected
The matrix has you
Follow the white rabbit
Wake up, Neo
Never send a human to do a machine's job
Ignorance is bliss
Free your mind
I know kung fu
Dodge this
I’m trying to free your mind
I can only show you the door
Don't think you are, know you are
There is no knowledge that is not power
Control the code, control the world
A hacker does for love what others wouldn't do for money
Hackers are the new rock stars
We can see the code
We’re gonna need a bigger firewall
Hacking is not a crime
Welcome to the revolution
You can’t handle the truth
Encryption is your friend
The future is now
Information is power
Password: Swordfish
The system is down
I’m a hacker, not a cracker
All your base are belong to us
Life is just a game
The truth is out there
Hack the planet and save the world
The code is strong with this one
Hack the system
We are legion
We never forgive, we never forget
Expect us
The game is rigged
We are the resistance
Fight the power
Information warfare
Cyberpunks never die
Hacktivism in action
In code we trust
We are the glitch in the matrix
The revolution will be digitized
We are everywhere
Knowledge is free
The first rule of hacking is you don’t talk about hacking
Hackers are the architects of the future
Code to survive
The digital underground
The power of the code compels you
Hack the mainframe
The only limit is your imagination
We are the cyber warriors
Decode the truth
The digital revolution
Think outside the firewall
Hackers for justice
Code is law
The cyber age has begun
We are the knights of the digital realm
Hacking for a better tomorrow
Code is thicker than blood
The digital frontier
The hacker’s manifesto
We write our own rules
The power of the code
Hack the future
